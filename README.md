### VERSION 1

Open "Multiplayer_cf.py," as that is the actual game file. The other two files are used, as they contain the individual game modes: Local, Multiplayer Host, and Multiplayer Client. Socket, pygame, and python3 must be installed for the game to work. Multiplayer is LAN only, meaning that it will only work if both players are connected to the same wifi.
Do not edit "stats.txt," as that would break the game by forcing the program to access indexes that cannot be converted to integers.

### VERSION 2
This branch of the project will eventually become the main project. Currently, V1 files are in the folders, and are untouched. V2 Files include GraphicalClient, GraphicalHost, and GraphicalLocal. I'm currently working on making a third graphical version that will act like a menu. As it stands, each graphical version needs to be opened individually.
